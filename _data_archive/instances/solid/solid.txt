    let fit: f32 = hervor.satiation as f32 + if hervor.dead {0.0} else {40.0} + if hervor.satiation == nplants {30.0} else {0.0};

hervor tries to get plants, curves, often tries to dodge chasers
sometimes just decides to go in a small circle - dont know why

chasers go mostly in staight lines but curve sometimes, they try to catch hervor
