chasers can see only hervor,
hervor can see plants and chasers,
plants dont respawn,
hervor alive => +40.0,
1 hervor, 2 chasers
~1600 gens, 1000 worlds

the hervor just goes in a straight line,
the chasers also go in a straight line, sometimes spinning in place

since the hervor cant see behind him, he doesnt know if he is being followed,
if he is, and he turns to pick up food, he is most likely going to die, so he just
goes in a straight line to make sure noone can catch up to him, he doesnt even steer
to evade chasers (maybe he would if there were only one chaser?), since he wraps around
the screen this allows him to get some plants while maximizing chance of survival

since the chasers cant catch up to hervor, they dont even try. they usually go in a
staight line and hope they will collide with the hervor, if he is at an angle to them,
they will try to steer into him. if they miss, they wont try to chase him, but will drift
off in a straight line again.
